# Android APK Build Guide - SMS Transaction Scanner

## ✅ Pre-Build Verification Complete

Your Android app is now **100% ready** for APK build. All SMS scanning and transaction verification is configured correctly.

---

## 🔧 What Has Been Configured

### 1. **Database & API Setup** ✅
- ✅ `sms_transactions` table configured with proper RLS policies
- ✅ `transaction_verifications` table ready for order matching
- ✅ Edge function `sms-transaction-handler` deployed and ready
- ✅ API endpoint: `https://mofwljpreecqqxkilywh.supabase.co/functions/v1/sms-transaction-handler`

### 2. **Native Android Code** ✅
Created three critical Java files:

#### **SMSReceiver.java**
- Automatically intercepts ALL incoming SMS messages
- Detects payment transactions from: bKash, Nagad, Rocket
- Extracts: Transaction ID, Amount, Gateway Type
- Sends data to server via edge function

#### **SMSMonitorService.java**
- Runs as foreground service for 24/7 monitoring
- Ensures app works even when closed
- Shows persistent notification "Transaction Scanner Active"

#### **MainActivity.java**
- Requests SMS permissions on app startup
- Starts SMS monitoring service automatically
- Handles permission grants/denials

### 3. **Server Communication** ✅
The app sends transaction data to your Supabase edge function:

```json
{
  "smsData": {
    "transaction_id": "ABC123XYZ",
    "sender_number": "+8801234567890",
    "message_content": "Full SMS text...",
    "wallet_type": "bkash",
    "amount": 1200,
    "timestamp": 1759891400000
  }
}
```

### 4. **Automatic Order Matching** ✅
The edge function automatically:
1. Stores SMS in `sms_transactions` table (audit trail)
2. Calls `match_sms_transaction_with_order()` function
3. Updates order status if transaction matches pending order
4. Stores in `transaction_verifications` for manual review if no match

---

## 📱 Supported Payment Gateways

The app detects transactions from:
- **bKash** - TrxID pattern
- **Nagad** - TxnId pattern  
- **Rocket** - Reference pattern

Detection patterns are built into `SMSReceiver.java` and can be easily extended.

## 📲 Testing Your APK

### Install on Device
```bash
adb install app-debug.apk
```

### Test SMS Scanning
1. Open the app
2. Grant SMS permissions when prompted
3. Send a test SMS from another phone:
   ```
   bKash Payment Received
   TrxID: TEST123XYZ
   Amount: Tk 100
   From: +8801234567890
   ```
4. Check notification: "Transaction Sent: TEST123XYZ"
5. Verify in Supabase: Check `sms_transactions` table

## 🔍 How Transaction Matching Works

### Scenario 1: Customer Places Order
1. Customer completes OTP verification
2. Payment screen shows transaction instructions
3. Customer sends 100 BDT advance payment
4. **Customer's Android app scans the payment confirmation SMS**
5. Transaction sent to server with transaction ID
6. Edge function matches with pending order
7. Order status updated to "confirmed"
8. WhatsApp notification sent to customer & admin

### Scenario 2: Manual Verification
1. If order doesn't exist yet, transaction stored in `transaction_verifications`
2. Admin can manually match from Payment Gateways page
3. Clicking "Verify" updates order and sends notifications
